# Agora Conversational AI TypeScript SDK

The `agora-agent-server-sdk` package lets you build real-time voice AI agents on the [Agora Conversational AI](https://docs.agora.io/en/conversational-ai/overview) platform. Create agents that listen, think, and speak — powered by any combination of LLM, TTS, and STT providers.

## Two conversation flows

**Cascading flow** — Speech-to-text feeds a text LLM, whose output is synthesized back to speech (ASR → LLM → TTS). This is the default path and supports the widest range of vendor combinations.

**MLLM flow** — A multimodal model (OpenAI Realtime or Vertex AI Gemini Live) handles audio end-to-end with no separate STT or TTS step. Lower latency for real-time conversation.

## SDK layers

The SDK has two layers:

| Layer | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Agentkit** (`Agent`, `AgentSession`, vendor classes) | High-level builder pattern, session lifecycle, typed vendors, automatic token generation | Most use cases |
| **Fern-generated core** (`client.agents`, `client.telephony`) | Direct REST client mapping every API endpoint | Advanced use cases requiring full control over request bodies |

The agentkit layer is built on top of the generated core. You can drop down to the raw client at any time via `session.raw`.

## Install

```sh
npm install agora-agent-server-sdk
```
